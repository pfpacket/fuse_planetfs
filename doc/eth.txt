This documents describes how ethernet services work.

Install:
  Ethernet services will be pre-installed statically.
 Once the services are installed, all network interfaces will be
  appeared in /net/eth/ (e.g. /net/eth/eth0, /net/eth/wlan0)

Uses:
  You can simply read and write the files to receive and send
 ethernet packets.
  If you want to see hex dumps of incoming packets, run the following:
   $ hexdump -C /net/eth/eth0
  And if you want to send a ethernet packet:
   $ cat eth_frame.bin > /net/eth/eth0
