This documents describes how DNS services work.

Install:
 Run the command below
  $ echo "load mod_net_dns" > /net/modules
 And to uninstall it
  $ echo "unload mod_net_dns" > /net/modules

 DNS services may be pre-installed statically.

Uses:
  Currently you cannot request DNS services to resolve host names
 by using basic commands like cat, echo.
  In point of view of system calls (and as a file), you just
 write requests to resolve names and read to get the results.
  Below shows the request format to write:

 Request format:
  [command] [hostname]

 [command] takes followings:
  resolve       - resolve a hostname to IPv4 and IPv6 (if available)
  resolve_inet  - resolve a hostname to IPv4 only
  resolve_inet6 - resolve a hostname to IPv6 only
 [hostname] takes the target host name.
